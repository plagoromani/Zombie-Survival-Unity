# Unity game demo: Survival Shooter

## Objective

The purpose of this project is to give Unity developers and designers
a place to show off their skills, by adding new features
or fixing issues to these games. This is part of [Wizcorp's](http://www.wizcorp.jp)
hiring process for selecting candidates, and allows developers and creative minds
to show to us and to the world what they can do.

The process is entirely public; this allows contributors to keep some
ownership on their contributions. This is a great way to build your online
presence.

Really, isn't that much better than a code test that will not serve you
as a person? Isn't it much better to be able to build a public portfolio of
code, and show how well you can do stuff in practice?

Our approach is open-source, collaborative, and allows great minds to truly show their true potential.

## Disclaimer

This project is a fork from [Unity's tutorials](http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules).
Wizcorp claims no ownership on this code and pledges not to use this
project for financial gain.
